/*
 * Feature and Parameter Negotiation
 * =================================
 * The two halves of a Xen block driver utilize nodes within the XenStore to
 * communicate capabilities and to negotiate operating parameters.  This
 * section enumerates these nodes which reside in the respective front and
 * backend portions of the XenStore, following the XenBus convention.
 *
 * All data in the XenStore is stored as strings.  Nodes specifying numeric
 * values are encoded in decimal.  Integer value ranges listed below are
 * expressed as fixed sized integer types capable of storing the conversion
 * of a properly formated node string, without loss of information.
 *
 * Any specified default value is in effect if the corresponding XenBus node
 * is not present in the XenStore.
 *
 * XenStore nodes in sections marked "PRIVATE" are solely for use by the
 * driver side whose XenBus tree contains them.
 *
 *
 * See the XenBus state transition diagram below for details on when XenBus
 * nodes must be published and when they can be queried.

 * Note: Drivers that do not support any optional features, or the negotiation
 *       of transport parameters, can skip certain states in the state machine:
 *
 *       o A frontend may transition to XenbusStateInitialised without
 *         waiting for the backend to enter XenbusStateInitWait.  In this
 *         case, default transport parameters are in effect and any
 *         transport parameters published by the frontend must contain
 *         their default values.
 *
 *       o A backend may transition to XenbusStateInitialised, bypassing
 *         XenbusStateInitWait, without waiting for the frontend to first
 *         enter the XenbusStateInitialised state.  In this case, default
 *         transport parameters are in effect and any transport parameters
 *         published by the backend must contain their default values.
 *
 *       Drivers that support optional features and/or transport parameter
 *       negotiation must tolerate these additional state transition paths.
 *       In general this means performing the work of any skipped state
 *       transition, if it has not already been performed, in addition to the
 *       work associated with entry into the current state.
